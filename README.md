# HSAP_JavaRMI_RAM_Summer2020
Hello! My name is Karthik Ramakrishnan, and I am a rising senior at Research Triangle High School in Durham, North Carolina. This repository contains most of my work (I could not upload some of my preliminary work due to that having over 100 files) from the summer of 2020 working with the RARE (Remote And Reconfigurable Environment) research group at North Carolina A&T State University on a Reconfigurable Resource Allocation Manager (RAM). All of the programs in this repository deal with adding doubles in some way. I was afforded this opportunity as part of the High School Apprenticeship Program (HSAP), a program funded by the Army Research Office (ARO).

## Contact Information
If you have any questions, please email me at karthik.ramki.rdu@gmail.com and I'll try to get back to you within two weeks. The format of your email should be as follows:<br/>
**(First and Last Name) - (Category Folder) - (Program Folder) as well as a program and a line number (if you can).**
I'll put an example:<br/>
*John Doe - TwoServersTwoClients - VersionTwo_SelfSufficient - FI.java - 9*
(again the "- FI.java - 9" is OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

If this format is not followed, I cannot respond.

## How to make a basic Java RMI program
I have linked the tutorials that I used to learn Java RMI:
* [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java_rmi/java_rmi_introduction.htm) <br/>
* [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/) <br/>

## TwoComputers
This program is meant to run on two computers: a server and a client.
