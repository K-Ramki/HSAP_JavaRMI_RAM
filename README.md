# HSAP_JavaRMI_RAM
Hello! My name is Karthik Ramakrishnan, and I am a rising senior at Research Triangle High School in Durham, North Carolina. This repository contains most of my work (I could not upload some of my preliminary work due to that having over 100 files) from the summer of 2020 working with North Carolina A&T State University on an Reconfigurable Resource Allocation Manager (RAM) as part of HSAP (High School Apprenticeship Program), a program funded by the Army Research Office (ARO).
